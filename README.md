This is a simple homemade build of the Digispark hardware design.  It is not a perfect duplicate, but does keep
the basic functionality of the commercial hardware.  Besides being built with a single-sided, non-plated 
through hole PCB, there are some major differences to note:

     1. Power Supply
        This implementation provides much less power than the Digispark.
        
     2. Female Headers
        The headers do not implement the Digispark footprint.
        
     3. USB Connector
        This design uses an actual connector instead of the PCB.
        
The rest of the differences and changes are the result of what parts I could get and what skills I have for
building such things.
